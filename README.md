## Payload

Payload is yet another file transfer application. (Yeah yeah, it's boring-ass, right?)

However, it offers a clean & slick interface (and a very messy code base)! Also a easily-pressable red button to delete all your stuffs at once! What's even better, it is WTFPL licensed! I mean how cool is that?!! 

You can serve the web file and the server separately, as API and static files are completely separated. So yeah, it is out there, I might not update it again, & do whatever you want! Thank you!
