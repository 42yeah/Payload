## Payload

Payload is yet another file transfer application. (Yeah yeah, it's boring-ass, right?)

However, it offers a clean & slick interface (and a very messy code base)! Also a easily-pressable red button to delete all your stuffs at once! Built by love, and also infinite hatred towards the school bandwidth, there is no reason not to use it! What's even better, it is WTFPL licensed! I mean how cool is that?!! 

You can serve the web file and the server separately, as API and static files are completely separated. So yeah, it is out there, I might not update it again, & do whatever you want! Thank you!

## So how can I use it?

Yeah, and here's how: 

```sh
git clone https://github.com/POTION4/Payload
cd Payload
npm init
node server.js
```

The default port is 23123, If you want to change the port, change it in server.js **and** js/settings.js. Isn't that cool? One config in two files! So there you go!
